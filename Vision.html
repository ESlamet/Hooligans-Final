                Hooligans seeks to bridge the gap between Web3 and Web2 Artists.
                Hooligans as a collective is an opportunity. An opportunity for
                all aspiring Web3 artists to embark on a new journey. A journey
                that promotes what NFTs are at its core, its artists and its
                community.
                <br />
                <br />
                Hooligans aims to reach and connect with aspiring artists in the
                Web3 space. This project will have one NFT collection with many
                different artists and art styles. Each artist is allocated a
                base and a collection size, to which they are free to design as
                they please. Hooligans believe in REAL Utility. Not only are
                members of the community getting exclusive artist specific NFTs,
                but purchasing a Hooligans NFT also helps provide exposure and
                job opportunities for other prospective Web3 Artists. This
                opportunity helps to support the up-and-coming Web3 Artists but
                also promotes the uplfitment of the NFT space as whole.
                <br />
                <br />
                By connecting with new artists eager to get into the space,
                Hooligans are increasing Web3 employment and involvement with
                artists from any background or following. And no, this isnt a
                one and done collection. Upon the first collections success,
                Hooligans will look to release another collection further
                employing more Artists in the space. If you are passionate about
                Web3 artwork, the NFT space and would like to know more, get in
